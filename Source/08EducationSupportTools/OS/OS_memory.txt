Among other things, a multiprogramming operating system kernel must be responsible for managing all system memory which is currently in use by programs.
This ensures that a program does not interfere with memory already in use by another program.
Since programs time share, each program must have independent access to memory.

Cooperative memory management, used by many early operating systems, assumes that all programs make voluntary use of the kernel's memory manager, and do not exceed their allocated memory.
This system of memory management is almost never seen any more, since programs often contain bugs which can cause them to exceed their allocated memory.
If a program fails, it may cause memory used by one or more other programs to be affected or overwritten.
Malicious programs or viruses may purposefully alter another program's memory, or may affect the operation of the operating system itself.
With cooperative memory management, it takes only one misbehaved program to crash the system.
