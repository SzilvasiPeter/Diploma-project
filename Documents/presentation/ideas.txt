1. Collection data to transfer it to knowledge and use it.
It is similar the Machine Learning(ML) and Human Learning (HL). Make parrallel for ML and HL. Collection data, transform/clean, use/train, validate.
2. Demonstrate Own experiments and implementation
2.1. Get Data (unbiased), Clean Data (balancing, clean), Visualize Data (intuition)
2.2. First exp. -> Split Data
2.3. Neural network structure. 2nd exp. complex structure -> simple structure
2.4. Sparse neural network. Place into the conext -> history/story about human brain vs machine "brain" (ANN). We can learn from mother nature.
Pruning the neural network. Experiment results/outcomes. (Maybe visualize why this happening)
2.5. Summarization. Extractive & Abstractive (GPT). Little side-note about commmon-sense.
2.6. QA system. The prototype (4phase). Using the BERT model. Performance of pruned-BERT models
3. Future development: NAS, fine-tune BERT, FL, Cloud
4. Final thoughts AI is a tool so we need use wisely. Wrong classification or prediction lead worse decision if we blindely accept it.
AI and Human hand in hand to make better decision, cuz AI extend Human and Human extend AI.
In order to use and extend human with AI in a large scale we need to use compression techniques (pruning, SET), to deploy easier, faster.
